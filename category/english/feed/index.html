<p>Imagine being on your favorite Linux distro with 10 different installers to run with 3 commands for each. That is not a good experience of course but I will explain you how to install all deb, AppImages, sh, Flatpak and some exes in only one command.</p>



<p>I called it <strong>AIP</strong> it&#8217;s Open Source (of course) and you can install it with the following commands:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>git clone https://github.com/chopin2712/Auto-Installer-process
cd Auto-Installer-process
sudo sh setup.sh</code></pre>



<p>Once you installed it you can go in the directory who contain the installer and open it in terminal.</p>



<p>Then run the following command:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>sudo aip</code></pre>



<p>Then your file will be installed and then removed (except for the .jar and .AppImage files formats who are exceptions because if you remove them you remove the software&#8230;)</p>



<h2> Don&#8217;t have installer(s)? </h2>



<p>If you know the package name but you don&#8217;t have the installer, there is another thing you can do with AIP. </p>



<p>Just run the following command:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>sudo aipn</code></pre>



<p>Then type the package name</p>



<p>Once you see in the terminal the app is installed, stop the script by pressing <strong>CTRL + D</strong> to prevent the conflicts.</p>



<p>Then your app will be installed if your package name is valid.</p>



<h2> Want to uninstall?</h2>



<p>There is no functions to uninstall the apps, but you can do it using <strong>Synaptic </strong>by running the following command:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>sudo synaptic</code></pre>



<p>Then you can search your package, check the box and choose <em>complete removal.</em></p>



<p>Click on <strong>Apply</strong> and then <strong>Confirm</strong> to uninstall the package(s).</p>



<h2> Want to contribute?</h2>



<p>You can get the source code on GitHub on the following link:</p>



<p> <a href="https://github.com/chopin2712/Auto-Installer-Process">https://github.com/chopin2712/Auto-Installer-Process</a></p>



<h2> Don&#8217;t works properly?</h2>



<p>You can post an issue on the GitHub project to get support or make a feature request. Thanks for using this app.</p>

<p>Hi! This is my real first post on this website. I will explain you how to use my latest creation. It is called MineCraft Server Setup (MCSS) and is an MC simple server installer. <em>Only linux (for the moment</em>)</p>



<p>It&#8217;s made with Python and it&#8217;s Open Source. You can browse the source <a href="https://github.com/chopin2712/MCSS">on this link</a>. I am very proud of this! It supports Vanilla, CraftBukkit and Spigot at the moment. This is a little tutorial to explain you how to create your very own MC server.</p>



<p>First run the following commands:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>git clone https://github.com/chopin2712/MCSS
cd MCSS
chmod +x install.sh
sudo sh install.sh</code></pre>



<p>Then create a new directory on your computer and open it in terminal&#8230;</p>



<p>The real magic happen here, you have just to run:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>sudo MCSS</code></pre>



<p>First answer 1 for Vanilla or 2 for craftbukkit/spigot.</p>



<p>Second, download the server.jar file on https://mcversions.net , put it in the directory then press enter. </p>



<p>Third, if you want to change the basics settings of Minecraft answer &#8220;Y&#8221; and modify your settings (TIPS: For online mode change into false to accept cracked versions)</p>



<p>For the &#8220;world wide step&#8221;, I recommend you to answer &#8220;N&#8221; to skip this part for the moment because this feature is not stable enough to be used successfully&#8230;</p>



<p>Finally your server will start, just wait 20 seconds and you can follow the above IP addresses to  join your world.</p>



<p>You can write &#8220;stop&#8221; to shut down your Minecraft Server and you can run &#8220;op USERNAME&#8221; to be admin on your server and run all the admins commands on it directly on Minecraft.</p>



<p>It is very simple to use in deed and my future ideas for this app are:</p>



<ul><li>Making the world wide feature works perfectly</li><li>Making available cross-platform</li><li>Possibly trying to make a visual GUI to use the app (far in the future)</li><li>Etc, etc</li></ul>



<p>You can contribute and access to this project by clicking on the following link:</p>



<p><a href="https://github.com/chopin2712/MCSS">https://github.com/chopin2712/MCSS</a></p>



<p>Already installed? You can update your version to a higher one by running the following script:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>git clone https://github.com/chopin2712/MCSS
cd MCSS
sudo sh install.sh
cd ..
sudo rm -r MCSS</code></pre>



<p> <em>NB: If you made  a server in  a older version, the update don&#8217;t have any effect and your server will works properly&#8230; </em></p>



<p>Thanks for your attention and hope you will try this app soon.</p>
